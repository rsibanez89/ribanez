When analyzing the market there are 2 major approaches:
* **Fundamental Analysis** is the use of economic data to predict future prices. It tries to find the real or "fair market" value. Using this approach involves researching micro and macro economics factors as well as studying the company balance sheets.
* **Technical Analysis** is the use of charts, historical and current prices to identify patterns and trends that forecast future prices.

Even though I consider that both approaches are important and should be combined, I will mostly use the Technical Analysis on this site. I consider that every technique used today will still work in the future, while fundamental data is always changing and a value that is reasonable today won't be reasonable in other micro and macro economic circumstances.

## Candlestick chart
The candlestick chart is the most common style of chart used by traders because it splits the data in equidistant periods called candles, making it easier for people to identify patterns.

### The candle
Each candle is a way or representing what happened with the price during that period. It provides a great amount of information that when it is combined with the context can help to forecast the next price movement. By looking at a candle you can see what was the opening price at that period, which one was the lowest price, which one was the highest price, which one was the closing price, and depending on the color you can see if the price is going up or down.

The narrow sticks at both ends of the candle are called shadows. They represent the battle between buyers and sellers and it provides even more information about what is happening with the price. A long shadow at the bottom of the candle means that the buyers are winning the battle and pushing the price up. On the other hand, a long shadow on the top of the candle means that the sellers are winning the battle and pushing the price down.

## Support and resistance
* A **support** level is an imaginary line (area) that acts as a barrier preventing the price to go further down. The price touches this barrier and changes direction going up again. 
* A **resistance** level is an imaginary line (area) that acts as a barrier preventing the price to go further up. The price touches this barrier and changes direction going down again.
