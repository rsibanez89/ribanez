# Choosing the right tool for the job
Over the past few years, I've been looking for a tool that allows me to easily style my website but also that allows me to write posts. My goal was to get a mix in between a blog and a wiki, where I can save all my findings for future usages.

I started by using plain html, css and javascript. This was a good idea at the time given that it was easy to setup, update and style. Although, using html tags in the middle of the text I was writting was unconfortable.

Some years later, I was learning [Angular](https://angular.io/start) so I decided to use it on my own personal website. What a terrible idea, I had to create components for each page and style them.

Finally, in 2019 I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). The tool allows me to focus on the text I'm writting as it uses the markdown language, which doesn't insert tags in the middle of the paragraphs. I also don't need to worry about the styles as I can use any of the predesigned templates. And creating a new post is as simple typing in the console.

```
> hugo new posts/new-post.md
```
